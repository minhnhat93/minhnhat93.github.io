Incoming PhD student at [PEESE group](https://www.peese.org), System Engineering, Cornell University. 
My research interest is reinforcement learning and optimal control for engineering systems and AI for science.
Previously I did a Master in Computing Science at the University of Alberta under Prof. [Nilanjan Ray](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/).
I also worked RL research at Huawei Canada and Koidra.ai after my Master.
